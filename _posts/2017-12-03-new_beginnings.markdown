I started as a nerdy kid always in school, learning curious about the world. When computers came along, it fascinated me with the colors, graphics. Got my first nintendo at the age of 8yrs and wow Mario and Luigi was the freakin' best. Mario was the best because of speed, then Luigi because he was tall like me and wore my favorite color green. As I got older, I got into finance, learning about different ways to convert use money. Then real estate sales, wow has it opened my eyes to the possibility of selling not just apartments in New York City but just about everything. Now with technology I would say its essential to learn computing, even how to code...it changes the way you think about solving problems for yourself and others. It's definitely one of the most adventurous and greatest challenges I've taken on thus far because it is difficult. I look at it as the beginning of something great, because in life, the greatest challenges produce the greatest rewards.
